# The Convenient Foodie

The Convenient Foodie is an application for ordering and fast delivery of food to the user's address. We are aware that it is best to have a meal in the comfort of your own home, and that there are more and more restaurants in the city in different remote locations where our most favorite food comes from, among which there are also restaurants that do not allow ordering. Our application solves this problem by connecting all restaurants to one place, from which the user can order his favorite meal to his home address with a few clicks.

## Running an application using Docker
To run an application using Docker, it is necessary to download [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for the operating system you are using. After starting docker, it is necessary to use the terminal to position yourself in the root of the project and run the 'docker compose up' command. Alternatively, you can download 'docker-compose.yml' from the root project, set the terminal to the location where this file is located, and run 'docker compose up'.

At the first launch, it is necessary to wait a certain time until all images are downloaded.
